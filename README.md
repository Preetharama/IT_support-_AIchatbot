I am Preetha R (21CS070), a pre-final year student from the CSE Department at Nandha Engineering College in Erode, Tamil Nadu. 
I have created an IT SUPPORTIVE chatbot AI using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
This is my first project in the field of web development.
I have designed a simple-level chatbot with login, sign-in, registration, and chatbot AI pages. 
PHP is used for data connectivity, with Examly software employed for server-side data storage.
Additionally, I have implemented user authentication before entering the chatbot.
This provides enhanced security, as the chat data cannot be altered, ensuring no leakage of privacy.
